This repository analyzes human body temperature from a statistical perspective. In this analysis I use computational and statistical methods (Bootstrapping Hypothesis Testing and Frequentist Testing) to extract relevant statistics (t and z). From here I evaluate the null hypothesis stating that human body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
